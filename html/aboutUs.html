            <h1>A Bowlful Of Happiness<br /></h1>
            <p>With over 300 venues across the world, LetYouEatMyNoodle is one of the fastest growing noodle chain originated here in
                Malaysia.<br /></p>
            <p>Every day, over 5 million guests visit LetYouEatMyNoodle restaurants from all around the world. The combination of
                affordability, consistency, and immaculate quality of food served 365 days a year ensures increasing success for many years to come.</p>
            <br />
    
            <h1>Where it all started...</h1>
            <p>Founded in 1996 in the town of Sungai Petani, Kedah, local blood and current company CEO Dato' Tan Zhong Yen
                was a businessman by trade, but a chef at heart.
                After realizing that a repetitive life of office work is tiresome and boring, he recalled his previous
                experiences as his family's personal chef and took
                a leap of faith into the kitchen industry.</p>
            <p>He started selling homemade bowls of noodles under the name XiaMianGeiNiChi for 2 years in his hometown. </p>
            <p>On the faithful day of 27th of July, 1996, he met with current CFO, Dr Ng Zhe Wei that was impressed by
                the former's unique and Kedah-inspired flavours.
                The two later partnered up that year and created newname, which has stayed successful for 27 years.</p>
    
            <h1>Meet Our Founders</h1>
            <div id="tzy">
                <h2>The Founding Father, Dato' Tan Zhong Yen</h2>
                <p>The Man behind the brand. Affectionally nicknamed "Father of Noodles" by the citizens of his hometown,
                    Kedah.</p>

                <p>He was born to a family of wheat farmers in 20th of February, 1961, on the poorer outskirts of Sungai Petani, Kedah.
                    With a heart of gold, yet ambissions of an emperor, he started watching her mother make noodles by hand, cooking them into
                    what he describes as "The Strands of Gold". After years of observing and slowly honing his skills with the stove, he was
                    made into the family's designated chef.</p>

                <p>However, as he had to move out of the country for his studies, he began to appreciate less the value of good home cooking,
                    and instead went to pursue an education in Buisness Management. He graduated with a Bachelor on Buisness Administration and went
                    into a high-paying job at a giant coorperate.</p>

                <p>After a decade of working in a dead-end office job, he found something amiss with his life. He realized that working in an office job
                    for the rest of his life was nothing he had envisioned his life to be like. In search of the missing piece, he took a week off and went back
                    to his hometown. At that point, he remembered the simple things that mattered in life. The home-made comfort food, the open-air seaside restaurants,
                    the children playing tag around the dirt roads, it had been the thing he missed the most in life. In a heartbeat, he quit his high-paying job and opened
                    up a restaurant at his hometown, and the rest was history.
                </p>

            <div id="nzw">
                <h2>The Expert on Numbers: Dr. Ng Zhe Wei</h2>
                <p>A natural born genius, he serves as the CFO of LetYouEatMyNoodle. Born and raised in Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpur, Dr. Ng Zhe Wei grew up
                    in a academically-focused household. The moment he learned how to count, he started learning how to do his family's finances from his father, also another successful financial advisor. 
                    Because of this, he acquired an interest on accounting and statistics from a very young age
                </p>
                <p>His ever expanding knowledge on the financial field meant that he graduated at the top of his accounting class in highschool. He then went to 
                    Tunku Abdul Rahman College (Now Tunku Abdul Rahman University of Management and Technology) and graduated with a GPA of 3.94 in Bachelor of Finance in 1989,
                    and got his doctorate in Accounting and Finance in 1995 after some time in the working field.
                </p>

                <p>After getting his doctorate, he had some trouble looking for work. He had recently quit his job a year ago in pursuit of his doctorate, but had found out that
                    he stopped enjoying working for pre-established coorperations. He decided to take a year off, travelling around Malaysia as he had wanted since he was a child.
                    On July 1996, one of his journeys took him to Sungai Petani, Kedah, where he had decided to try out a small local noodle restaurant. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    According to him, the unique taste each and every bite intrigued him so much that he asked the owner for the recipe, 
                    to which he was replied with a smile:"I do not have one. I just did whatever feels right and makes me happy." The ownner's philosophy reminded Dr. Ng Zhe Wei about the
                    simpler mindset he had left behind as a working adult, and the reason why he hated working for pre-established coorperations. He wanted to
                    be a huge part of something that is, to him, something that makes him happy too. And so, he decided to partner up with the owner to advertise his brand of
                    homemade noodles, and the rest is history.
