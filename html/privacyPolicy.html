            out in this privacy policy. We will retain and use your personal data to the extent necessary to
            comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply
            with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
        <p>The company will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally
            retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security
            or to improve the functionality of our service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data
            for longer time periods.</p>
        <h3>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the company's operating offices and in
            any other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. It means that this
            information may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state,
            province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ
            than those from Your jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>Your consent to this privacy policy followed by your submission of such information represents
            your agreement to that transfer.</p>
        <p>The company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely
            and in accordance with this privacy policy and no transfer of your personal data will take place
            to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the
            security of your data and other personal information.</p>
        <h3>Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p>You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the personal data that we have
            collected about you.</p>
        <p>Our service may give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the
            service.</p>

            you have one, and visiting the account settings section that allows you to manage your personal
            information. You may also contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal
            information that you have provided to us.</p>

        <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, the company may be required to disclose your personal data if
            required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or
            a government agency).</p>
        <h4>Other legal requirements</h4>
        <p>The company may disclose your personal data in the good faith belief that such action is
            necessary to:</p>
